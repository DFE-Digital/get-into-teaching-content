This is a type of qualification offered by School-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) providers and Universities. Other types of training providers, who offer salaried training options, may also offer a PGCE qualification.

The majority of postgraduate teacher training courses are made up of:

* academic study of the theory of teaching (also known as 'pedagogy')
* hands-on experience in the classroom

The course typically lasts a year (3 school terms). You can study for a PGCE and gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). A PGCE may allow you to teach in some other countries too. 

Available for primary, secondary, and further education teacher training.

Courses can cost up to Â£9,250, and you may be eligible for a bursary or loans to cover course fees or living costs.
