On these courses, you’ll be paid and taxed as an unqualified teacher. The salary awarded will differ between schools.

These courses do not offer bursaries, scholarships or student finance. 

There are two types: 

### School Direct training programme (fee-funded)

Open to all graduates and funded in a similar way to a university or SCITT led course. Trainees pay tuition fees (from £9,000) and may be eligible for a bursary or loans.

### School Direct training programme (salaried)

Usually for graduates with three of more years career experience. The trainee is employed as an unqualified teacher by the school. The school receives funding to finance this. 

Both lead to QTS.
