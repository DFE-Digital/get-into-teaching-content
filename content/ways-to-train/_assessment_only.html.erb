<p>If you’re an experienced teacher with a degree, you can gain QTS without doing a teacher training programme. You’ll need to present detailed evidence that you meet the standards for QTS.</p>

<p>A number of universities and School Centred Initial Teacher Training programmes (SCITTs) around the country offer Assessment Only routes. Their criteria for entry may vary, and you will need to apply to them directly.</p>

<p>For more information about Assessment Only options, you can view a list of approved providers in our directory.
