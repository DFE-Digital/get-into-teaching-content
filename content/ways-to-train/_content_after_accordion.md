### Things to consider

There may also be a difference in the final qualification you receive depending on which school or training provider you select and the type of training they provide.

For all training options you will spend time gaining classroom experience, a minimum of 24 weeks in 2 schools. As trainee or newly qualified teacher, youâ€™ll have support, including a mentor to build your confidence and teaching skills.

You may be eligible for funding to pay for course fees and support with living costs whilst in training.
