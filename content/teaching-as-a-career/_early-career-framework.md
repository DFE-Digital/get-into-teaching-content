## Early Career Framework

The Department for Education has developed a 2 year package to support new teachers at the start of their career, based on the [Early Career Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-early-career-teachers).

The Early Career Framework was designed with an expert advisory group to support early career teacher development.

The support package includes:

* funded 5% time off timetable in the second year of teaching, in addition to the existing 10% in the first year
* a range of high-quality, freely available curricula and training materials underpinned by the Early Career Framework
* funded training for mentors of early career teachers
* funded time for mentors to support early career teachers

The support package will be launched:

* to early rollout areas in September 2020
* nationally from September 2021

This is part of governmentâ€™s commitment to transform support for early career teachers.
