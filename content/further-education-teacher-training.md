## Becoming a Further Education teacher

Being a Further Education (FE) teacher means you’ll teach students from 14 to adult. Further education covers an hugely diverse range of subjects and qualifications. 

As an FE teacher, you’ll be improving your students’ qualifications and future job prospects - as well as inspiring those who simply want to enjoy building new skills and knowledge.

Further education qualifications range from basic literacy and numeracy to higher-level apprenticeships and technical qualifications, including the new T levels, which are vocational alternatives to A levels.

FE students come from a range of backgrounds and levels of experience. People come to FE from local schools, the community, industry and local businesses. Because there’s no national curriculum for FE, courses are often tailored to meet employer needs and are delivered in a range of different settings, such as colleges, community centres, private training centres or workplaces.

### How to become a further education teacher

Because the courses and qualifications are so varied, the qualifications teachers need are too. There are qualifications on education and training, as well as the specialised subject-area skills or qualifications that a teacher is expected to have. You might even be able to gain new qualifications while you teach.
