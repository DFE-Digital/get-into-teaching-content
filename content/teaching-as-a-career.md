## Inspire the next generation

As a teacher you can help children develop their talents and expand your own skills too.

In addition to the day job you can get involved in after-school activities, clubs, trips or sport.

## Career progression

Training to be a teacher will give you the opportunities to add to your professional skills and help you achieve your ambitions.

The Department for Education (DfE) has made it easier to find a teaching role in England, by using the [Teaching Vacancies service](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).

## Leadership

Leadership roles in a school can offer a number of different opportunities, from taking charge of a year group or a particular key stage; to becoming a deputy or headteacher.

As a leader, you’ll have an influence in the school, setting high standards and ensuring continuous improvement throughout the school.

## Focus on your subject

If you’re passionate about your subject area, you can pursue a career as a head of department or as a leading practitioner.

In these roles you’ll still teach, but have additional responsibilities.

## Pastoral care

If you’re interested in the welfare of students throughout their education, a pastoral role might be for you. You could also take on the role of a mentor for young people with special educational needs.

## Early Career Framework

The Department for Education has developed a 2 year package to support new teachers at the start of their career, based on the [Early Career Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-early-career-teachers).

The Early Career Framework was designed with an expert advisory group to support early career teacher development.

The support package includes:

* funded 5% time off timetable in the second year of teaching, in addition to the existing 10% in the first year
* a range of high-quality, freely available curricula and training materials underpinned by the Early Career Framework
* funded training for mentors of early career teachers
* funded time for mentors to support early career teachers

The support package will be launched:

* to early rollout areas in September 2020
* nationally from September 2021

This is part of government’s commitment to transform support for early career teachers.
