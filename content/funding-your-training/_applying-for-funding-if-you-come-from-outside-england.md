## Applying for funding if you come from outside England

Whether you’re a home student (living in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland), an EU student or a student from outside the EU, you may still be eligible for funding to train to teach.

If you live in [Wales](http://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/), [Scotland](http://www.saas.gov.uk/) or [Northern Ireland](http://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk/) you’ll need to contact your country’s student finance body.

Contact the education authority if you live in the Channel Islands ([Jersey](https://www.gov.je/Working/Careers/16To19YearOlds/EnteringHigherEducation/FinancingHigherEducationCourses/FundingDegreeProfessionalQualifications/Pages/index.aspx) and [Guernsey](https://www.gov.gg/article/152744/Policies)) or [Isle of Man](https://www.gov.im/student-grants).

You could get a bursary or scholarship, student finance and extra funding to train to teach.

If you’re an EU national starting a teacher training course in the academic year 2021/22, you may get a bursary or scholarship, and student finance.
