## Tuition fee and maintenance loans

You can apply for a tuition fee loan to pay for your training so you don't need to pay anything upfront. You can also apply for a maintenance loan to help with living costs and you may be able to get a [bursary or a scholarship](#bursaries-and-scholarships).

Even if a bursary or scholarship is available for your course, you can get student finance to cover your fees and help with your living costs. You can apply for a tuition fee and/or a maintenance loan even if you already have a student loan.

You can apply for a tuition fee loan of up to £9,250 to cover the full cost of your course fees and a maintenance loan of up to £12,010 to help with your living costs.

You will only have to make repayments when you're earning. Your repayments will not increase if you already have a student loan and take a loan out for teacher training.
