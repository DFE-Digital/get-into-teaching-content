## Bursaries and scholarships

Bursaries and scholarships are tax-free amounts of money to train in certain subjects. You don’t need to pay them back.

You’ll need a first, 2:1, 2:2 degree or a PhD or Master's to be eligible for a bursary.

For a scholarship, each professional scholarship body sets its own criteria.

You could get a bursary of up to £24,000 or apply for a scholarship of up to £26,000.
