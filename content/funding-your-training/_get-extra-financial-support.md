## Extra financial support for parents, carers or people with disabilities

You may be able to get extra financial support if you have a disability, or if you have children or dependent adults. If you get this type of funding, you do not need to pay it back.

You could apply for:

* [Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA)](https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowances-dsas/how-to-claim)
* [Childcare Grant](https://www.gov.uk/childcare-grant)
* [Parents Learning Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/parents-learning-allowance)
* [Adult Dependants’ Grant](https://www.gov.uk/adult-dependants-grant)
