## Introduction

The level of financial support you get will depend on the subject you
choose and the way you train to become a teacher.

There are several types of funding that may all be available to you,
depending on your eligibility:

  - a bursary or scholarship
  - tuition fee and maintenance loans
  - extra financial support if you're a parent, a carer, or you have a
    disability

Please note that alternative funding is in place to train as an Early
Years teacher, which leads to achieving Early Years Teacher Status
(EYTS).
