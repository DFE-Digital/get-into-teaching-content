## Tuition fee and maintenance loans

You can take out a loan with [student
finance](https://www.gov.uk/teacher-training-funding) to cover your
tuition fees and help with your living costs (maintenance loan).

You can apply for:

  - a tuition fee loan of up to £9,250 to cover the full cost of your
    course fees
  - a maintenance loan of up to £12,010 to help with your living costs

If you already have an undergraduate student loan, or have been awarded
a bursary or scholarship, you can still apply for both a tuition fee and
a maintenance loan.

Use the [student finance calculator](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance-calculator)
to find out how much you can get.

### If you already have a student loan

You are only required to make repayments on your loan if you took it
out:

after 1 September 2012 and you are earning over £26,575

before 1 September 2012 and you are earning over £19,390

Your repayments will not increase if you take out another loan for
teacher training.
