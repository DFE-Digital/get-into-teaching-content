Find out how to train to become a teacher in England.

[Already a teacher? Come to England to teach](/international-candidates#already-a-teacher-teach-in-england)

## Train to teach in England

As an international candidate you’ll be welcomed by many teacher training providers in England.

Train in England and you'll graduate from a world-class institution, with qualifications recognised around the world.

Not looking to train in England? Consider training in [Wales](https://www.discoverteaching.wales/routes-into-teaching/), [Scotland](https://teachinscotland.scot/) or [Northern Ireland](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/initial-teacher-education-courses-northern-ireland).

### What you need to start training

To start postgraduate teacher training in England, you need:

#### A university degree

Your degree can be from outside the UK.

If you do not have a degree yet, you can [apply to an undergraduate teaching course](https://www.ucas.com/postgraduate/teacher-training/train-teach-england/undergraduate-teacher-training-england) instead of a postgraduate course.

#### English and maths qualifications

You usually need the equivalent of a GCSE (grade 4) in English and maths.

To teach children aged 3 to 11, you also need the equivalent of a GCSE (grade 4) in a science subject.

[Contact UK ENIC to find out if your qualifications meet the standard](https://www.enic.org.uk/)

#### An offer to train

Explore the [different qualifications you can get](/international-candidates#what-qualifications-you-can-get) and [find a postgraduate course in England](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses).

Contact providers before you apply to get their advice about eligibility and the application process.

#### The right visa or status

Unless you're an [Irish citizen](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance) you'll need to [get the right visa or status to study in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants#visas-and-immigration).

You usually need a confirmed offer on a course to apply for a visa.

#### To pass certain checks

Your training provider will check you’re suitable for teaching in terms of your health, safeguarding and your level of maths and English.

### Funding

[Check your eligibility for financial support for teacher training](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants#financial-support-for-non-uk-applicants-for-unsalaried-teacher-training-in-england)

### Get support

You can get an adviser for one-to-one support.

Your adviser can help you get a 'statement of comparability' which shows [how your overseas qualifications compare to UK qualifications](https://enic.org.uk/Qualifications/SOC/Default.aspx)

</p>

Or [search for an undergraduate teacher training course](https://digital.ucas.com/search)

### What qualifications you can get

#### Qualified teacher status (QTS)

QTS allows you to apply for paid teaching jobs in all schools in England.

You need QTS to work in many English schools, but it’s desirable for all teaching jobs.

#### PGCE with QTS

You can do a course which combines QTS with a Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE). This includes some academic study.

#### PGCEi

You do not necessarily have to be in England to study with an English institution. You can do a Postgraduate Certificate of Education International (PGCEi) outside the UK.

A PGCEi will help you develop your teaching skills and knowledge.

However, it does not lead to QTS and will not qualify you to teach in schools in England which require QTS.

## Already a teacher? Teach in England

Teach in England and you’ll benefit from working in a world-class education system.

You’ll earn a competitive salary, get supported in your professional development and have varied job opportunities.

Not looking to teach in England? Consider teaching in [Wales](https://www.discoverteaching.wales/), [Scotland](https://teachinscotland.scot/) or [Northern Ireland](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/initial-teacher-education-courses-northern-ireland).

### What you need to start teaching

To teach in England you need:

* teaching skills and experience
* to pass criminal and professional safeguarding checks (these will be organised by your employer)
* to [get the right visa or status](/international-candidates#get-the-right-visa-or-status)

It is also helpful to have a teaching qualification from your own or another non-UK country, or to get '[qualified teacher status](/international-candidates#consider-getting-qualified-teacher-status)'.

### Get the right visa or status

Unless you're an [Irish citizen](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance) you'll need to [get the right visa or status](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teach-in-england-if-you-qualified-outside-the-uk/teach-in-england-if-you-qualified-outside-the-uk#visas-and-immigration).

Some job offers allow you to apply for a ‘skilled worker visa’. Otherwise, you may be eligible for another type of visa.

You may have a pre-existing right to work in the UK, such as settled or pre-settled status under the [EU Settlement Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families) or [indefinite leave to remain in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk).

### Consider getting qualified teacher status

You need 'qualified teacher status' (QTS) to teach in many state schools in England.

It's not a requirement in all [types of schools](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school), such as academy schools, free schools, private schools and independent schools. However, having QTS can help your application.

If you’re a qualified teacher from outside the UK you can [work as a teacher in England for up to 4 years without QTS](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recruit-teachers-from-overseas#employing-overseas-teachers-without-qts-the-4-year-rule).

[Apply for QTS if you trained outside the UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) or find out more about qualifications.

### Get support if you're qualified to teach maths, physics or modern languages

* the application process, such as writing a personal statement and preparing for an interview
* accessing courses to enhance your subject knowledge
* finding teaching vacancies
