## Become an early years teacher
 
As an early years teacher, you'll work with young children up to the age of 5. Your input will have a lasting and positive effect on their development and wellbeing.
 
By training to be an early years teacher, you’ll use your knowledge and skills to help young children enjoy high standards of teaching. 

The early years are critical in children's development. You’ll be opening their minds to new ideas every day.
 
###How to become an early years teacher
 
You’ll need to achieve Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS). This is different from Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), which is the equivalent for teaching children aged 3 to 18. 

Your training will enable you to meet the [early years teachers' standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-teachers-standards).
 
To start early years teacher training, you’ll need these qualifications (or to demonstrate an equivalent standard):

* Maths grade 4 (C)
* English grade 4 (C)
* Science grade 4 (C)

If you do postgraduate early years teacher training, you'll need a 2:2 bachelor’s degree with honours or higher.
 
[Contact one of our early years training providers to apply for a place](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-initial-teacher-training-itt-providers-and-school-direct-early-years-lead-organisations/early-years-initial-teacher-training-itt-providers-and-school-direct-lead-organisations).

## Ways to train

$EY-undergraduate$

A full-time bachelor’s degree in an early childhood-related subject leading to EYTS. [Undergraduate tuition fee loans are available from Student Finance England
(SFE)](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance).

$EY-graduate$
 
Bursaries are available, including:

 * £5,000 if you have a first class degree
 * £4,000 if you have a 2:1 degree
 * £2,000 if you have a 2:2 degree
 
$EY-graduate-employment$

This one-year part-time route is for graduates working in an early years setting who need further training to meet the Teachers’ Standards (Early Years). Funding of up to £14,000 is available. This would cover course fees of up to £7,000, plus £7,000 for your employer, to help cover their extra costs while you train.

$EY-self-funded$ 

This self-funded route is ideal for graduates with early-years experience. If you already meet the Teachers’ Standards (Early Years), you can gain the qualification without the need for further training.
