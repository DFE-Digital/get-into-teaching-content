### Online events

Online teaching events are interactive sessions that offer a convenient way to engage directly with a panel of specialist advisers across a range of topics. 

You can get your questions answered within minutes – and see what matters to other potential trainee teachers too. Joining a conversation is easy – remember to check in regularly to see what discussions we’ve got lined up.
