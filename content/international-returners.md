Are you a UK teacher currently working abroad? Our children and young people
need your international skills, experience and perspective.

If you're thinking about coming home to teach, we want to help.

### Using DfE's Teaching Vacancies service to find your next role

75% of schools in England now advertise their teaching  jobs on DfE's free
[Teaching Vacancies service](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).
You can set up a job alert to search jobs by:

* working pattern (full or part-time)
* location
* subject
* role
* educational phase (primary, middle, secondary, 16-19)

Schools and heads in England recognise the value of your overseas experience.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they are also increasingly familiar and
comfortable with remote recruitment and assessment.

Download our information pack for lots of helpful hints and tips about
preparing your application and getting ready for interview.

### Return to teaching success stories

Read inspiring case studies and join our webinar to take part in a live Q&A
with a teacher who's successfully made the move back home.

### Extra support for shortage subjects

If you teach maths, physics or modern foreign languages, you're eligible for
personalised support from the Return to teaching support service.

You can get:

* help and advice from a teaching adviser over phone and email
* information on vacancies in your local area
* tips on application and interview prep
* advice on subject specialist training courses
* online courses and webinars
* membership of our closed Facebook group

Register with Get an advisor to get help from the Return to teaching support
service, or call the Return to teaching helpline on 0800 085 0971 (charges may
apply for calls made from overseas).

### Continuous professional development (CPD) and teaching salaries

DfE can support your CPD through National Professional Qualifications (NPQs)
for middle and senior leadership, headship and executive leadership.
[We'll be introducing improved NPQs from September 2021](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-professional-qualifications-frameworks-from-september-2021).

In July 2020, competitive new salary increases for teachers were agreed.

### Supporting our critical workers in education

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vital role of teachers, who continue
to show extraordinary dedication and commitment. We at DfE are profoundly
grateful for the hard work and sacrifice of everyone in the profession.


[Read our COVID-19 guidance for school and teachers](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-for-schools-coronavirus-covid-19).

Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, DfE was working hard to improve life for
teachers in England by reducing teaching stress and workload. We've
collaborated with schools to:

* [develop a workload reduction kit](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-workload-reduction-toolkit)
* [invest £10m in Behaviour hubs](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-hubs) so schools with exemplary pupil behaviour can help other schools improve
* increase [flexible working opportunities](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flexible-working-resources-for-teachers-and-schools) for teachers

Teacher mental health is an important focus for DfE. [Read our Teaching blog](https://teaching.blog.gov.uk/category/teacher-wellbeing/teacher-mental-health/) to learn more.


## Return to teach in England: step by step

### 1. Download our information pack & register for our next webinar

Our information pack contains lots more helpful advice and information about your journey home.

### 2. Check your qualifications

If you trained to teach in England, you will already have [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts).

If you have been working as a teacher overseas without QTS, you should be aware that in many schools funded by the UK government in England (‘state schools'), teachers must have this qualification.

Even where QTS is not a legal requirement, many schools use it to assess the quality of candidates for teaching jobs.

You will therefore strengthen your application for teaching jobs in England in both the state sector and [private sector](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/private-schools) if you have QTS.

If you have experience working as a teacher, and a degree, you may be able to get QTS through the assessment only route without any further training.

If you have fewer than 2 years of teaching experience, you will need to apply for a [teacher training course](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/) leading to QTS.

### 3. Find your next role

Register with Teaching Vacancies and set up your job alerts.

### 4. Get ready to apply

  [#UKEdChat](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23UKEdChat) on Twitter)
* collecting evidence of your performance and experience overseas (this can include lessons recorded on video, testimonials from your headteacher)
* getting a police clearance certificate and/or a letter of good conduct
* writing your supporting statement
* arranging your references
* reading up on [teaching interview tips](https://www.teachertoolkit.co.uk/2019/04/04/job-interviews)
