If you trained to teach in England, you will already have [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts).

If you have been working as a teacher overseas without QTS, you should be aware that in many schools funded by the UK government in England (‘state schools'), teachers must have this qualification.

Even where QTS is not a legal requirement, many schools use it to assess the quality of candidates for teaching jobs.

You will therefore strengthen your application for teaching jobs in England in both the state sector and [private sector](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/private-schools) if you have QTS.

If you have experience working as a teacher, and a degree, you may be able to get QTS through the assessment only route without any further training.

If you have fewer than 2 years of teaching experience, you will need to apply for a [teacher training course](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/) leading to QTS.
