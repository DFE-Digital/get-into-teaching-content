## Teacher salaries

Schools develop their own pay policies to attract and retain teachers that have the greatest impact on their pupils' learning. What you're paid will be linked to performance, not length of service - meaning your salary can move forward in line with your career.

## Teacher benefits

### Teaching and learning responsibility (TLR) payments

If you take on extra ongoing responsibilities in your role, you could get a salary uplift.

There are two main ranges for these (TLR 1 and TLR 2), depending on the category your duties come under:

* TLR 1 £8,291 - £14,030

### Holidays

You'll get more days than people in many other professions. Full-time teachers work for 195 days per year in school.

###Teachers’ Pension Scheme

The Teachers’ Pension Scheme gives you a regular source of income when you retire. It is:

* based on your salary and service rather than investments
* registered with HM Revenue and Customs - so your contributions are tax-free
* flexible and allows you to take some of it as a tax-free lump sum
