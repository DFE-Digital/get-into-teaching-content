You’ll need a first, 2:1, 2:2 degree or a PhD or Master's to be eligible for a bursary.

For a scholarship, each professional scholarship body sets its own criteria.

You could get a bursary of up to £24,000 or apply for a scholarship of up to £26,000.

## Tuition fee and maintenance loans

You can apply for a tuition fee loan to pay for your training so you don't need to pay anything upfront. You can also apply for a maintenance loan to help with living costs and you may be able to get a [bursary or a scholarship](#bursaries-and-scholarships).

Even if a bursary or scholarship is available for your course, you can get student finance to cover your fees and help with your living costs. You can apply for a tuition fee and/or a maintenance loan even if you already have a student loan.

You can apply for a tuition fee loan of up to £9,250 to cover the full cost of your course fees and a maintenance loan of up to £12,382 to help with your living costs.

You will only have to make repayments when you're earning. Your repayments will not increase if you already have a student loan and take a loan out for teacher training.

## Early Career Framework

The Department for Education has developed a 2 year package to support new teachers at the start of their career, based on the [Early Career Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-early-career-teachers).

The Early Career Framework was designed with an expert advisory group to support early career teacher development.

The support package includes:

* funded 5% time off timetable in the second year of teaching, in addition to the existing 10% in the first year
* a range of high-quality, freely available curricula and training materials underpinned by the Early Career Framework
* funded training for mentors of early career teachers
* funded time for mentors to support early career teachers

The support package will be launched:

* to early rollout areas in September 2020
* nationally from September 2021

This is part of government’s commitment to transform support for early career teachers.
