## Bursaries and scholarships

Bursaries and scholarships are tax-free amounts of money to train in certain subjects. You don’t need to pay them back.

You’ll need a first, 2:1, 2:2 degree or a PhD or Master's to be eligible for a bursary.

For a scholarship, each professional scholarship body sets its own criteria.

You could get a bursary of up to £24,000 or apply for a scholarship of up to £26,000.

[Find out more about bursaries and scholarships](/guidance/financial-support-for-teacher-training#introduction).

## Tuition fee and maintenance loans

Even if a bursary or scholarship is available for your course, you can get student finance to cover your fees and help with your living costs. You can apply for a tuition fee and/or a maintenance loan even if you already have a student loan.

You can apply for a tuition fee loan of up to £9,250 to cover the full cost of your course fees and a maintenance loan of up to £12,010 to help with your living costs.

You will only have to make repayments when you're earning. Your repayments will not increase if you already have a student loan and take a loan out for teacher training.

Use the [student finance calculator on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance-calculator) to find out how much you can get.

## Get extra financial support if you’re a parent, a carer or you have a disability

You may be able to get extra financial support if you have a disability, or if you have children or dependent adults. If you get this type of funding, you do not need to pay it back.

You could apply for:

* Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA)
* Childcare Grant
* Parents Learning Allowance
* Adult Dependants’ Grant

Find out more about extra financial support for [parents and carers](/guidance/financial-support-for-teacher-training#parents-and-carers---extra-financial-support) and [people with disabilities](/guidance/financial-support-for-teacher-training#disabled-students---extra-financial-support).

## Applying for funding if you come from outside England

Whether you’re a home student (living in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland), an EU student or a student from outside the EU, you may still be eligible for funding to train to teach.

If you live in [Wales](http://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/), [Scotland](http://www.saas.gov.uk/) or [Northern Ireland](http://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk/) you’ll need to contact your country’s student finance body.

Contact the education authority if you live in the Channel Islands ([Jersey](https://www.gov.je/Working/Careers/16To19YearOlds/EnteringHigherEducation/FinancingHigherEducationCourses/FundingDegreeProfessionalQualifications/Pages/index.aspx) and [Guernsey](https://www.gov.gg/article/152744/Policies)) or [Isle of Man](https://www.gov.im/student-grants).

You could get a bursary or scholarship, student finance and extra funding to train to teach.

If you’re an EU national starting a teacher training course in the academic year 2021/22, you may get a bursary or scholarship, and student finance.
