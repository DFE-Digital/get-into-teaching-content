## Get ready for your next step

Enjoy free expert one-on-one advice on getting school experience, writing your personal statement, finding funding, applying for training, passing course interviews and more.

Are you interested in becoming a teacher, but not sure what to do next? When you’re at the start of your teacher journey it can feel overwhelming. But help is at hand. We can connect you with an experienced teacher who knows the system inside out.

### What an adviser can do for you

They’ll guide you through each step of the process from wherever you are. And they’ll help you feel ready for each stage: working out who you want to teach, applying for funding, filling in application forms and much more - right through to getting on to the right teacher training course for you. Trainee teachers say they’ve particularly valued help with: 

* Arranging school experience
* Seeking out financial support
* Writing your personal statement
* Preparing for course interviews

> I can genuinely say that I wouldn't have completed my application without my adviser.

### Personalised help for you

Taking on teacher training and preparing for a new career can be daunting for anyone, but taking your next step might be more complicated if you have caring responsibilities, people dependent on your earnings, or you are living with a disability. Your Teacher Training Adviser can help you navigate your path into teaching, and make sure you get any additional help that is available. Your adviser will be just a call, message or email away.

> It's tailor-made to individual needs. I received an abundance of help.

### Are you ready for an adviser

To sign up, you’ll need one of these:

* Bachelor’s degree with honours, grade 2:2 or higher
* Predicted grade 2:2 or higherfor your bachelor’s degree with honours, if you’re still a student
* Overseas qualification equivalent to a bachelor’s degree with honours, grade 2:2 or higher

Not sure how your qualification compares? An adviser can help with that.

## How a Teacher Training Adviser can help you succeed 

#### Corinne wanted to become a chemistry teacher, and was paired with adviser Leilah

Shortly after beginning to fill in my application form I received a telephone call, from the Teacher Training Adviser service, which was a relief. 

> Applying for teacher training is an in-depth process, and it’s good to have guidance.

I can genuinely say that I wouldn’t have completed my application without my adviser. She was a qualified teacher, so she knew the system very well and understood how it felt to be on the ‘other side’. She was extremely helpful as well as thoughtful and understanding.

> The most desirable feature is that it's tailor-made to individual needs. 

I received an abundance of help, which included: finding my way round the UCAS Teacher Training website, understanding the various training options, small details regarding the application process, personal statement tips, advice on qualification equivalency and taking the skills tests.
