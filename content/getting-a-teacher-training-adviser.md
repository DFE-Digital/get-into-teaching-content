  <summary>How a Teacher Training Adviser can help you succeed</summary>

### Corinne wanted to become a chemistry teacher, and was paired with adviser Leilah
 <p>
Shortly after beginning to fill in my application form I started working with Leilah, which was a relief.

Applying for teacher training is an in-depth process, and it's good to have guidance.

I can genuinely say that I wouldn't have completed my application without my adviser. She was a qualified teacher, so she knew the system very well and understood how it felt to be on the 'other side'. She was extremely helpful as well as thoughtful and understanding.

I received an abundance of help, which included: understanding the various training options, small details regarding the application process, personal statement tips and advice on qualification equivalency.
