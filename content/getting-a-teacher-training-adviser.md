## Free expert one-to-one advice

Interested in becoming a teacher, but not sure what to do next? Getting into teaching can feel overwhelming. An experienced teacher who knows the process inside out can guide you.

Your adviser will be with you all the way, with as much or as little help as you need – right through to getting onto the right course for you. 


### What an adviser can do for you

Trainee teachers say they’ve particularly valued help with: 

* School experience
* Financial support
* Personal statements
* Interview preparation

### What you'll need

To sign up, you’ll need one of these:

* Bachelor’s degree with honours, grade 2:2 or higher
* Predicted grade 2:2 or higher for your bachelor’s degree with honours, if you’re still a student
* Overseas qualification equivalent to a bachelor’s degree with honours, grade 2:2 or higher

Not sure how your qualification compares? An adviser can help with that.

> I can genuinely say that I wouldn't have completed my application without my adviser. The most desirable feature is that it’s tailor-made to individual needs.
