<b>Corinne wanted to become a chemistry teacher, and was paired with adviser Leilah.</b>
<br>
Shortly after beginning to fill in my application form I received a telephone call, from the Teacher Training Adviser service, which was a relief. 

> Applying for teacher training is an in-depth process, and it’s good to have guidance.

I can genuinely say that I wouldn’t have completed my application without my adviser. She was a qualified teacher, so she knew the system very well and understood how it felt to be on the ‘other side’. She was extremely helpful as well as thoughtful and understanding.

> The most desirable feature is that it's tailor-made to individual needs. 

I received an abundance of help, which included: finding my way round the UCAS Teacher Training website, understanding the various training options, small details regarding the application process, personal statement tips, advice on qualification equivalency and taking the skills tests.
