* join a [teaching union](https://www.tes.com/jobs/careers-advice/pay-and-conditions/which-teachers-union)
* read up on [teaching interview tips](https://www.teachertoolkit.co.uk/2019/04/04/job-interviews) if it’s been a while since your last interview, as well as specific [pointers for remote interviewing](https://www.tes.com/news/coronavirus-10-tips-acing-remote-job-interview)

### Getting qualified

If you taught overseas as an unqualified teacher, you'll need [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) to teach in a maintained school in England.

If you're experienced and have a degree, you may be able to get QTS through the [assessment only](/guidance/become-a-teacher-in-england/#assessment-only-candidates-already-working-in-school) route without any further training.

If you have fewer than 2 years of teaching experience, you can get qualified on a [teacher training course](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk).
