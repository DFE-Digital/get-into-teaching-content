If you’ve been out of teaching for a while, you may want to:

* review the latest [Teachers’ Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards)
* catch up on changes to the [national curriculum and qualifications](https://www.gov.uk/topic/schools-colleges-childrens-services/curriculum-qualifications)
* read through current behaviour management guidelines – see the Department for Education’s [advice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/behaviour-and-discipline-in-schools)
