## Improving the lives of teachers

The Department for Education is creating the environment for all teachers to thrive including:

* supporting schools to reduce workload, including embedding use of the [Workload Reduction Toolkit](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/reducing-school-workload#school-workload-reduction-toolkit)
* announcing a range of public commitments to improve mental health and wellbeing, including the creation of the first ever Education Staff Wellbeing Charter
* [invest £10m through Behaviour Hubs](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-hubs) so that schools with exemplary behaviour can work closely with other schools that want and need to improve behaviour
* promoting examples of effective [flexible working opportunities](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flexible-working-resources-for-teachers-and-schools) for teachers

You can search for jobs with flexible working patterns by using [Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).
