If you’ve been out of teaching for a while, you may want to:

* review the latest [Teachers’ Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards)
* catch up on changes to the [national curriculum and qualifications](https://www.gov.uk/topic/schools-colleges-childrens-services/curriculum-qualifications)
* read through current behaviour management guidelines – see the Department for Education’s [advice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/behaviour-and-discipline-in-schools)

### Return to teaching advisers

If you want to return to teach modern foreign languages, maths or physics at secondary school, we can help.

Our return to teaching advisers offer one-to-one support with:

* how to find teaching vacancies
* applications, writing personal statements and preparing for teaching interviews
* finding Teacher Subject Specialist Training (TSST) courses to enhance your subject knowledge

## Finding a role

[Search for a teaching role in England](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/). You can set up job alerts so that you do not miss out on any opportunities.

Take a look at the different [types of schools and staff roles](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school) to find the best opportunity for you.

We can give you one-to-one support if you’re returning to teach modern foreign languages, maths or physics.

### National Tutoring Programme

This provides two different options to return to a school environment without taking on a full-time or part-time classroom role.

Find out [how to apply and get more information about 'Tuition Partners' and 'Academic Mentor' pillars of the National Tutoring Programme](https://nationaltutoring.org.uk/).

## Support for returners identifying with protected characteristics

Support for returners (such as coaching opportunities) may be available if you identify with one or more of the protected characteristics as defined by the Equality Act 2010.

Details of organisations which represent certain characteristics are listed below:

* [WomenEd](https://www.womened.org/)
* [BAMEed](https://www.bameednetwork.com/)
* [LGBTed](http://lgbted.uk/)
* [DisabilityEd (Twitter account)](https://www.twitter.com/disability_ed)

## Teachers who trained in England returning from overseas

This is for UK and non-UK nationals who have trained to teach in England and are interested in returning to teach here after teaching overseas.

If you're looking for new opportunities in England, we're here to support you and progress your career in teaching.

The diversity, culture, different teaching methods you've experienced and skills you've acquired will be an invaluable asset to our schools, children and young people.

[Read stories about teachers with international experience who've made the move back to England.](/my-story-into-teaching/international-career-changers/)

### Preparing yourself for the move to England

You may wish to:

* join the [Chartered College of Teaching](https://chartered.college/), the professional body for teachers
* join a [teaching union](https://www.tes.com/jobs/careers-advice/pay-and-conditions/which-teachers-union)
* read up on [teaching interview tips](https://www.teachertoolkit.co.uk/2019/04/04/job-interviews) if it’s been a while since your last interview, as well as specific [pointers for remote interviewing](https://www.tes.com/news/coronavirus-10-tips-acing-remote-job-interview)
* ensure your [pension is up to date](https://www.teacherspensions.co.uk/members/working-life/life-events/moving-abroad.aspx)
* check the [FCO’s travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice)

### Getting qualified

If you taught overseas as an unqualified teacher, you'll need [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) to teach in a maintained school in England.

If you're experienced and have a degree, you may be able to get QTS through the [assessment only](/guidance/become-a-teacher-in-england/#assessment-only-candidates-already-working-in-school) route without any further training.

If you have fewer than 2 years of teaching experience, you can get qualified on a [teacher training course](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk).

## Improving the lives of teachers

A lot has changed for teachers in England over the last few years.

The Department of Education has worked with schools to:

* [reduce the hours teachers work](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-workload-survey-2019)
* [develop a workload reduction kit](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-workload-reduction-toolkit)
* [invest £10m through Behaviour Hubs](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-hubs) so that schools with exemplary behaviour can work closely with other schools that want and need to improve behaviour
* increase [flexible working opportunities](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flexible-working-resources-for-teachers-and-schools) for teachers

You can search for jobs with flexible working patterns by using [Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).
