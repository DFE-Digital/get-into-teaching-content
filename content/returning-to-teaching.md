Returning to teaching might be easier than you expect, and we’re here to help
make the transition as smooth as possible.

Expert advice, support and helpful resources are available if you’re
considering returning to teaching, or you’re qualified to teach but have never
taught in a state school in England.

If you’ve been out of teaching for a while, you may want to:

* attend an [online return to teaching event](/events/return-to-teaching-8)
* review the latest [Teachers’ Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards)
* catch up on changes to the [national curriculum and qualifications](https://www.gov.uk/topic/schools-colleges-childrens-services/curriculum-qualifications)
* read through current behaviour management guidelines – see the Department
  for Education’s [advice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/behaviour-and-discipline-in-schools)

Other things to consider:

* join the [Chartered College of Teaching](https://chartered.college/), the
  professional body for teachers
* join a [teaching union](https://www.tes.com/jobs/careers-advice/pay-and-conditions/which-teachers-union)
* read up on [teaching interview tips](https://www.teachertoolkit.co.uk/2019/04/04/job-interviews)
  if it’s been a while since your last interview, as well as specific
  [pointers for remote interviewing](https://www.tes.com/news/coronavirus-10-tips-acing-remote-job-interview)
* ensure your [pension is up to date](https://www.teacherspensions.co.uk/members/working-life/life-events/moving-abroad.aspx)

## Finding a role

[Search for a teaching role in England](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).
You can set up job alerts so that you do not miss out on any opportunities.

Take a look at the different [types of schools and staff roles](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school)
to find the best opportunity for you.

We can give you one-to-one support if you’re returning to teach modern foreign
languages, maths or physics.

### National Tutoring Programme

This provides two different options to return to a school environment without
taking on a full-time or part-time classroom role.

Find out [how to apply and get more information about 'Tuition Partners' and
'Academic Mentor' pillars of the National Tutoring Programme](https://nationaltutoring.org.uk/).

## Improving the lives of teachers

The Department for Education is creating the environment for all teachers to
thrive including:

* supporting schools to reduce workload, including embedding use of the
  [Workload Reduction Toolkit](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/reducing-school-workload#school-workload-reduction-toolkit)
* announcing a range of public commitments to improve mental health and
  wellbeing, including the creation of the first ever Education Staff Wellbeing Charter
* [invest £10m through Behaviour Hubs](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-hubs)
  so that schools with exemplary behaviour can work closely with other schools
  that want and need to improve behaviour
* promoting examples of effective [flexible working opportunities](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flexible-working-resources-for-teachers-and-schools)
  for teachers

You can search for jobs with flexible working patterns by using [Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).
