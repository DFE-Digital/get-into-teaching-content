Returning to teaching might be easier than you expect.

If you’re considering coming back to the profession, or if you’re qualified to teach but have never taught in a state school in England, we’re here to help.  

## Why now?

Thousands of former teachers return to teaching each year. 
 
Here at the Department for Education, we’re taking action to address some of the common issues that teachers face in the classroom, by helping schools to [reduce workload](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-workload-reduction-toolkit), supporting mental health and wellbeing, and [publishing guidance on flexible working](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flexible-working-resources-for-teachers-and-schools) and [manage behaviour](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-hubs). 
 
The education sector promotes inclusivity and diversity, and there are many organisations who support teachers with protected characteristics, such as [WomenEd](https://www.womened.org/), [BAMEed](https://www.bameednetwork.com/), [LGBTed](http://lgbted.uk/) and [DisabilityEd](https://www.twitter.com/disability_ed).

You can search for jobs easily, including those with flexible working patterns, by using [Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/). 

## Return to teaching advisers

If you want to return to teach modern foreign languages, maths or physics at
secondary school in England, we can help.

Our return to teaching advisers can give free one-to-one support with:

* help with applications process, writing personal statements and preparing for
  teaching interview
* accessing courses to enhance your subject knowledge
* how to find teaching vacancies

## Find a role

[Search for a teaching role in England](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).
You can set up job alerts so that you do not miss out on any opportunities.

Take a look at the different [types of schools and staff roles](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school)
to find the best opportunity for you.

## National Tutoring Programme

The National Tutoring Programme supports schools to close the attainment gap in light of the coronavirus pandemic and provides two different options to return to a school environment without taking on a full-time or part-time classroom role. 

If you’re unsure about taking on a teacher role at this time, you could consider [applying to tutor or mentor through the National Tutoring Programme](https://nationaltutoring.org.uk/). 

## Been out of teaching for a while?

There’s lots you can do to re-familiarise yourself with teaching. For example, you can:  

* attend an [online return to teaching event](/events/return-to-teaching-8)
* review the latest [Teachers’ Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards)
* catch up on changes to the [national curriculum and qualifications](https://www.gov.uk/topic/schools-colleges-childrens-services/curriculum-qualifications)
* read through current behaviour management guidelines – see the Department
  for Education’s [advice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/behaviour-and-discipline-in-schools)
* join the [Chartered College of Teaching](https://chartered.college/), the
  professional body for teachers
* join a [teaching union](https://www.tes.com/jobs/careers-advice/pay-and-conditions/which-teachers-union)
* read up on [teaching interview tips](https://www.teachertoolkit.co.uk/2019/04/04/job-interviews)
  if it’s been a while since your last interview, as well as specific
  [pointers for remote interviewing](https://www.tes.com/news/coronavirus-10-tips-acing-remote-job-interview)
* ensure your [pension is up to date](https://www.teacherspensions.co.uk/members/working-life/life-events/moving-abroad.aspx)
