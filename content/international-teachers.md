## Teaching in England

Your route to working as a teacher in England and the financial support you might get depends on:


* your nationality or residency status
* what you want to teach
* your current level of qualification

## How to apply for teaching jobs in England

### Qualified teacher status (QTS)

In many schools funded by the UK government in England ('[state schools](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school)'), teachers must have 'qualified teacher status' (QTS).

International qualified teachers are allowed to work as a teacher in England for up to 4 years without QTS.

Learn more about the ‘[4 year rule](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recruit-teachers-from-overseas#employing-overseas-teachers-without-qts-the-4-year-rule)’.

However, you’ll strengthen your application for teaching jobs in the UK in both the state sector and [private sector](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/private-schools) if you have QTS.

### Schools which do not require QTS

Within the UK state school sector, academy schools    and free schools    do not require QTS.

Outside the state school sector, ‘private schools’ or ‘independent schools’ do not require QTS. [Learn more about teaching and training to teach in a private or independent school in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/private-schools).

## How to apply for QTS

### Fast-track application for teachers who qualified in the following countries

* the [European Economic Area](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea) (EEA)
* Australia
* Canada
* New Zealand
* Switzerland
* USA

If you are qualified to teach in one of these countries, you can apply to the UK's Teaching Regulation Agency for QTS.

Your application may take up to 4 months to process, but you will not need to do any further teacher training to get QTS.

[Different rules apply if you are a national of one of the countries listed here, but have teaching qualifications from another country](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts#teachers-from-the-eu-iceland-liechtenstein-norway-or-switzerland).

Apply to the Teaching Regulation Agency for QTS

### Assessment only QTS for teachers who qualified in other countries

Teachers from outside [the EEA](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea), Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland and the USA can apply for assessment only QTS.

[Learn how to apply for QTS if you trained outside the](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts).

##To work as a teacher

First, search for teaching jobs using [Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).

Before you apply for a teaching job, contact the school to check they are a Home Office licensed employer sponsor – sponsors can help you apply for your visa.

You’ll be able to apply for your skilled worker visa if:

* you have an offer for a salaried training place or a teaching job with a school that is a licensed Home Office employer sponsor
* you can speak, read, write, and understand English
* your role pays at least: i) £20,480; or ii) the relevant minimum rate for teachers in the region of England where you are working or training – whichever is higher. Pro-rata rates will apply if you work part-time as long as you earn at least £20,480 per annum

## How to apply for a visa which allows you to work

From 1 January 2021, the UK is introducing a new [points-based immigration system](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know).

If you are a non-UK citizen from a country outside the European Economic Area    (EEA) and Switzerland, you may already need a visa to study or work in the UK. [Check if you need a visa under the current immigration system](https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa).

### EU Settlement Scheme

If you are a citizen of a country inside the [European Economic Area](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea) (EEA) or Switzerland, living in the UK by 31 December 2020, you can apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.

If your application is successful, you can continue to live, work and study in the UK after 30 June 2021. You will not need to use the points-based immigration system explained here.

### Changes to the UK’s immigration system

The new points-based immigration system will apply to all non-UK citizens arriving in the UK from 1 January 2021, including those from the EEA or Switzerland.

You can now apply for a [student visa](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa) under the new system; other immigration routes to live and work in the UK will open over the course of 2020.

### Irish citizens

Irish citizens will continue to be able to enter, work and study in the UK as they do now.

## Choosing the correct visa for your teaching job

For teaching jobs in England, the main visa route is the ‘[skilled worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know#skilled-workers)’.

For teacher training in England, the main routes are either the ‘[student visa](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa)’ or the ‘[skilled worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know#skilled-workers)’.

Depending on your personal circumstances, you may be eligible for [other visas](#other-visas) which allow you to work or study in the UK.

### Other visas

Depending on your personal circumstances, you may be able to work or study in the UK on alternative visas – for example, the [Family visa](https://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa) or [UK Ancestry visa](https://www.gov.uk/ancestry-visa). Use this [UK government service](https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa) to check.
