## Becoming a qualified teacher in England

These steps are for people wanting to become qualified teachers in England.

To work as a qualified teacher in a state school in England, you will need to
have Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). There are a number of ways to gain QTS
such as completion of postgraduate initial teacher training (ITT) or a degree
course with QTS included.
