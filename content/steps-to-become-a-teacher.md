## Become a qualified teacher in England

Follow these steps if you want to become a qualified primary or secondary school teacher in England.

If youâ€™re interested in teaching in another area, take a look at our guidance on:

* becoming a further education teacher <mark>(link to be added)</mark>
<!-- * [becoming a further education teacher](/further-education-teacher-training) -->
* [becoming an early years teacher](/early-years-teaching-training)

To work as a qualified primary or secondary school teacher in a state school in England, you need to
have Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).

There are a number of ways to get QTS, such as:

* completing a postgraduate initial teacher training (ITT) course
* doing a degree course which leads to QTS

We also have information for:

* [international candidates](/international-candidates)
* [those returning to teaching](/returning-to-teaching)
