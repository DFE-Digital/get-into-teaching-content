There are a few ways to train to become a teacher. Each route has different eligibility criteria, end qualifications, and funding options. These will depend on which school or training provider you select and the type of training they provide.

Some things you may want to think about:

* how long you want to study for
* if the course is in a convenient location for you
* what end qualification you would like
* whether you meet the eligibility criteria
* what funding you may need for any tuition fees or living expenses
