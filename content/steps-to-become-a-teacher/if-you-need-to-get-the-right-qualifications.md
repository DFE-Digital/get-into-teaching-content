## If you don’t have a degree

You’ll need to apply for an initial teacher training (ITT) course that will give you qualified teacher status (QTS). Courses take 1 to 4 years and may include one of these:

* Bachelor of Education degree (BEd) with QTS
* Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Science (BSc) with QTS

Alternatively, if you are currently studying for, or have already been awarded your Bachelor's degree and you want to train to become a teacher in England, then you can study for a postgraduate certificate of education (PGCE).

Search [UCAS](https://digital.ucas.com/search) to find a degree with QTS or a PGCE course.

## Increase your knowledge of the subject you want to teach

If you need to top up your knowledge of the subject you want to teach, you could take a [subject knowledge enhancement course (SKE)](/guidance/train-to-become-a-teacher#subject-knowledge-enhancement-ske-courses).

A SKE may be right for you if:

* your degree is not in the subject you want to teach, but is related
* you studied the subject at A level, but not at degree level
* you have an unrelated degree, but relevant professional experience in the subject
* it’s been some time since you used your degree knowledge

If you want more information, read the [government guidance on SKE courses](/guidance/train-to-become-a-teacher#subject-knowledge-enhancement-ske-courses).

## Specialist ways to get into teaching

### School Direct salaried places

You’ll earn a [salary while you train](/guidance/train-to-become-a-teacher#salaried-teacher-training-courses) and you will not pay tuition fees. These places are usually given to graduates with at least 3 years’ work experience.
Postgraduate teaching apprenticeship

[Postgraduate teaching apprenticeships](/guidance/train-to-become-a-teacher#salaried-teacher-training-courses) are similar to school direct salaried places. You’ll be employed by a school to learn on the job over 4 terms. You’ll then take an assessment. This is a salaried training place so you will not pay tuition fees.

### Career changers

If you want a [career change and fancy becoming a teacher](/guidance/train-to-become-a-teacher#career-changers), you’ll get the chance to use your life and work experience coupled with your passion for your subject to inspire young people. There's plenty of support to get into teaching and make the career change.

### High Potential ITT

You’ll need to have a 2:1 degree or higher to apply for a place on the programme, currently delivered by [Teach First](/guidance/train-to-become-a-teacher#high-potential-itt). You’ll train over 2 years by learning on the job, paid as an unqualified teacher and you will not pay tuition fees. You’ll be placed into a school straight away and gain QTS in your first year and complete your Newly Qualified Teacher placement in year 2.

You’ll also receive leadership training, which includes a fully-funded Postgraduate Diploma in Education and Leadership, worth double the credits of a PGCE.

### Researchers in schools

You’ll need (or be about to finish) a doctorate in the [subject you want to teach](/guidance/train-to-become-a-teacher#researchers-in-schools-candidates-with-a-doctorate). You’ll then train over 3 years with a bursary. If you have a lot of relevant work experience you could train and earn a salary.

### Assessment only (AO)

If you’re a teaching assistant or unqualified teacher with two years’ experience you can be [assessed over 12 weeks to get QTS](/guidance/train-to-become-a-teacher#assessment-only-candidates-already-working-in-school). This way of getting QTS will not give you a PGCE.

### Postgraduate Early Years Initial Teacher Training (EYITT)

A number of postgraduate Early Years Initial Teacher Training (EYITT) courses are available at university or via a school-led route – all lead to [Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS)](/guidance/train-to-become-a-teacher#teaching-under-fives) on successful completion. EYTS is different to QTS in that you specialise in working with children up to five years old only.
