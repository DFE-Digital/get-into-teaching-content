After youâ€™ve submitted your application, you may be contacted to provide copies of your supporting documents. These could be: 

* your degree certificate
* your academic degree transcript
* evidence of your qualifications or equivalent

You may be invited to attend an interview. Providers will be looking for qualities that would make you a good teacher, and evidence of relevant skills. 

Teacher training advisers can help you prepare for interviews, and support you through the whole application process.
