Once you have decided that you want to train to become a teacher and have the necessary qualifications you’ll need to [prepare your application](https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-teacher-training) using the following steps:

* [choose your course](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses)
* write a personal statement
* get two references
* apply for teacher training either through [Apply for teacher training GOV.UK service](https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-teacher-training), or by using the [UCAS Teacher Training](https://2021.teachertraining.apply.ucas.com/apply/student/login.do)

Apply for teacher training will eventually replace UCAS, but for now, the new service is limited to certain providers.

Use Apply for teacher training if:

* all your chosen training providers are available through this new service
