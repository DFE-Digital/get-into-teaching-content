Before you commit to a training course, you’ll need to decide if teaching is for you, what subject you want to teach, and whether you want to teach primary, secondary, or even in a college. 

Some resources you can use to help you make these decisions: 

### Go to an event 
Events give you a chance to talk to real teachers, experts, and training providers about every aspect of teaching and teacher training. They cover everything from funding your training, a day in the life of a teacher, to what you’ll need for a successful application.
