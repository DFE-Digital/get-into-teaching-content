Before you commit to a teacher training course, you might want to spend some time in a school. This can give you valuable first-hand experience of what teaching might be like, and what’s involved during a teacher’s day. It may also give you a chance to see a range of lessons and age groups being taught.

Having some school experience may strengthen your teacher training application, and give you experience to draw on in an interview.

You can approach schools and teachers yourself or search for school experience in your area using our service.
