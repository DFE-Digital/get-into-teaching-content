To start initial teacher training, you'll need to have a degree, or equivalent qualification.

If you're unsure whether your qualification is equivalent to a degree, you can [talk to us, or chat online](/steps-to-become-a-teacher#talk-to-us).

If you want to teach in a fee-paying or private school, the rules may be different. You’ll need to check with the school you want to teach at.

If you want to teach in a primary or secondary school you can apply for postgraduate initial teacher training (ITT) to give you qualified teacher status (QTS). This usually takes a year, unless you study part-time. All ITT courses include a minimum of 24 weeks in school - usually two schools or more.

To study for ITT, you’ll need these qualifications or their equivalents:

* English GCSE grade 4 (C) or above
* Maths GCSE grade 4 (C) or above
* Science GCSE grade 4 (C) or above if you want to teach in primary education

If you do not have the required GCSEs, you’ll need to show that you have an equivalent level of education.

If your degree is not in the subject you want to teach, or it's been a while since you studied, you may be able to take a [subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course](/guidance/train-to-become-a-teacher#subject-knowledge-enhancement-ske-courses).

Here's what you need to do if you:

* [do not have a degree](/steps-to-become-a-teacher/if-you-need-to-get-the-right-qualifications#if-you-dont-have-a-degree)
* [have an overseas degree](/international-candidates)
* [are returning to teach in England](/experienced-teachers)
