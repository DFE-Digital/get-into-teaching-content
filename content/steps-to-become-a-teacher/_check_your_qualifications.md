To start postgraduate initial teacher training, you'll need to have a degree or equivalent qualification.

[Find out what to do if you do not have a degree](/guidance/become-a-teacher-in-england#if-you-do-not-have-a-degree).

You’ll also need:

* English GCSE grade 4 (C) or above
* Maths GCSE grade 4 (C) or above
* Science GCSE grade 4 (C) or above if you want to teach in primary education

If you do not have the required GCSEs or you have [overseas qualifications](/international-candidates), you’ll need to show that you have an equivalent level of education.

If you're already qualified to teach, see our guidance on [returning to teach in England](/returning-to-teaching).
