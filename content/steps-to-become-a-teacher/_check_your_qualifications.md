To start initial teacher training, you'll need to have a degree, or equivalent qualification. If you do not have a degree - you can do an [undergraduate course](/ways-to-train).

You’ll also need:

* English GCSE grade 4 (C) or above
* Maths GCSE grade 4 (C) or above
* Science GCSE grade 4 (C) or above if you want to teach in primary education

If you do not have the required GCSEs or you have overseas qualifications, you’ll need to show that you have an equivalent level of education.

If you're unsure whether your qualifications are equivalent to what you need, you can [talk to us](#talk-to-us).
