## How to apply for teaching jobs in England

### Qualified teacher status (QTS)

In many schools funded by the UK government in England ('[state schools](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school)'), teachers must have 'qualified teacher status' (QTS).

International qualified teachers are allowed to work as a teacher in England for up to 4 years without QTS.

Learn more about the ‘[4 year rule](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recruit-teachers-from-overseas#employing-overseas-teachers-without-qts-the-4-year-rule)’.

However, you’ll strengthen your application for teaching jobs in the UK in both the state sector and [private sector](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/private-schools) if you have QTS.

### Schools which do not require QTS

Within the UK state school sector, academy schools    and free schools    do not require QTS.

Outside the state school sector, ‘private schools’ or ‘independent schools’ do not require QTS. [Learn more about teaching and training to teach in a private or independent school in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/private-schools).
