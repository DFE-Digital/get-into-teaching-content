## Ways to train or work as a teacher in the UK without a skilled worker visa or a student visa

### Graduate visa

If you are already an international student in the UK, you can apply for a [graduate visa](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know#international-students-and-graduates) on successful completion of your degree. This visa will be available from summer 2021 and you will need to have been sponsored by a Home Office licensed student sponsor to apply.

The graduate visa will allow you to study, work, or look for work in the UK for up to 2 years after completing your studies (3 years for PhD students), without a sponsor. This includes training as a teacher on a salaried or unsalaried initial teacher training course.

You will be able to switch from a graduate visa to another visa (such as the [skilled worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa) without having to leave the UK, if you meet the requirements for the new visa.

### The Youth Mobility Scheme visa

The [Youth Mobility Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/youth-mobility) allows young people from Australia, Canada, Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea and Taiwan to come to the UK.

You must be 18 to 30 years old to apply. If you are successful, you’ll be able to study or work in the UK without a sponsor. This includes working as a teacher or training as a teacher via either a salaried or unsalaried initial teacher training course.

A Youth Mobility Scheme visa lasts up to 2 years. You may be able to switch from a Youth Mobility Scheme visa to another visa route (for example the skilled worker visa   ) without having to leave the UK. You’ll need to meet the requirements for the other visa route.

### Other visas

Depending on your personal circumstances, you may be able to work or study in the UK on alternative visas – for example, the [Family visa](https://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa) or [UK Ancestry visa](https://www.gov.uk/ancestry-visa). Use this [UK government service](https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa) to check.
