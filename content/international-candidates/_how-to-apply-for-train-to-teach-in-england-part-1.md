## How to apply to train to teach in England

### Funding

If you’re an EU national starting a teacher training course in the academic year 2021/22, you may get a bursary or scholarship, and student finance on a similar basis to domestic students if you have settled or pre-settled status under the [EU Settlement Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families), and meet the usual residence requirements.

### What you’ll need

* achieved a standard equivalent to a grade 4 in GCSE English and mathematics
* a university degree

To teach children aged 3 to 11, you also need to have achieved a standard equivalent to a grade 4 in a GCSE science subject.
