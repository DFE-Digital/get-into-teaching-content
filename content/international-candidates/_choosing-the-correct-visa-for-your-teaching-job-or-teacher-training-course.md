## Choosing the correct visa for your teaching job or teacher training course

For teaching jobs in England, the main visa route is the ‘[skilled worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa)’.

For teacher training in England, the main routes are either the ‘[student visa](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa)’ or the ‘[skilled worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa)’.

Depending on your personal circumstances, you may be eligible for [other visas](/international-candidates#other-visas) which allow you to work or study in the UK.

### Teacher training: skilled worker or student visa?

The type of visa you need will depend on whether you are on a salaried or unsalaried teacher training course. (See also our [guidance on other visas](/international-candidates#other-visas) you may be eligible for.)

A ‘salaried’ teacher training course means you are paid to work in a school while you learn to teach.

An ‘unsalaried’ teacher training course means you pay a fee to study as a teacher.

* unsalaried includes higher education institution programmes, school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) programmes and the School Direct fee-funded programme

### Applying for a student visa for an unsalaried teacher training course

For an unsalaried teacher training course, you will need a [student visa](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa). Student visas must be sponsored by a Home Office licensed student sponsor.

First, choose your teaching training provider using [Find postgraduate teacher training](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses).

Then, contact your chosen teacher training provider to check they are a Home Office licensed student sponsor – sponsors can help you apply for your visa.

You’ll be able to apply for your visa if you:

* have an unconditional offer of a place on a course with a Home Office licensed student sponsor teacher training provider
* have a reference number, called a confirmation of acceptance for studies (CAS), which your training provider will give you
* have enough money to support yourself and pay for your course
* [can speak, read, write, and understand English](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/knowledge-of-english)

### Applying for a skilled worker visa for a salaried teacher training course, or to work as a teacher

For a salaried teacher training course or to work as a teacher, you will need a [skilled worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know#skilled-workers). Skilled worker visas are sponsored by Home Office licensed employers.

### For salaried teacher training

First, choose your teaching training provider using [Find postgraduate teacher training](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses).

Then, contact your chosen teacher training provider to ask about the school where you’ll be employed during your training. The school must be a Home Office licensed employer sponsor – sponsors can help you apply for your visa.

### To work as a teacher

First, search for teaching jobs using [Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).

Before you apply for a teaching job, contact the school to check they are a Home Office licensed employer sponsor – sponsors can help you apply for your visa.
You’ll be able to apply for your skilled worker visa if:

* you have an offer for a salaried training place or a teaching job with a school that is a licensed Home Office employer sponsor
* you can speak, read, write, and understand English
* your role pays at least: i) £20,480; or ii) the relevant minimum rate for teachers in the region of England where you are working or training – whichever is higher. If you work part-time, pro-rata rates will apply as long the salary is at least £20,480 per annum
