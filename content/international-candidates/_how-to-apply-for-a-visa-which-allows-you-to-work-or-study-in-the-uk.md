## How to apply for a visa which allows you to work or study in the UK

The UK introduced a [points-based immigration system](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know) on 1 January 2021.

### EU Settlement Scheme

If you are a citizen of a country inside the [European Economic Area](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea) (EEA) or Switzerland, and were living in the UK before 31 December 2020, you can apply to the [EU Settlement Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families).

If your application is successful, you can continue to live, work and study in the UK after 30 June 2021. You will not need to use the points-based immigration system explained here.

### Changes to the UKâ€™s immigration system

The points-based immigration system applies to all non-UK citizens arriving in the UK from 1 January 2021, including those from the EEA or Switzerland.

### Irish citizens

Irish citizens can continue to enter, work and study in the UK under the [Commmon Travel Area](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance/common-travel-area-guidance) as they did previously.
