With a 2:1 degree in biology and health and safety management, I initially pursued a career as a health and safety adviser. But realised this wasn’t allowing me to use my knowledge of biology, and I wanted to work with young people and really make a difference – so teaching was the ideal profession for me.

I chose a teacher training course led by a school with the Arthur Terry National Teaching School. Teacher training has its ups and downs, but is it’s all worth it. When you get through to a child and see their eyes light up with curiosity and wonder, you remember what brought you into teaching.

> I also received a generous training bursary that has supported me throughout the duration of the course

I had to demonstrate my potential as a teacher. I had to teach some year 7 students, and that was the best part of the interview! I would advise others to prepare well in advance and to plan your lesson in as much detail as you can – but most importantly, 'be yourself.'

Teacher training has been by far one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. It has made me realise my potential, testing the limits of my patience, confidence, organisational skills and empathy, as well as academic ability.
