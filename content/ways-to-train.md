# Train to get qualified teacher status

You need ‘qualified teacher status’ to work in the majority of schools in England including state maintained primary, secondary and special schools.

There are different ways to get qualified teacher status.

Not looking for primary or secondary teacher training? Consider teaching [early years](/early-years) or [further education](/further-education).

## Find a path that suits you

[I want to go to university as a postgraduate student](#go-to-university-as-a-postgraduate-student)

[I want to learn on the job in schools near me](#learn-on-the-job-in-schools-near-you)

[I do not have a degree yet](#if-you-do-not-have-a-degree-yet)

[I already have teaching experience](#if-you-already-have-teaching-experience)

You can also find programmes tailored to you [if you're a career changer](#if-you-are-a-career-changer) or [if you have a doctorate](#if-you-have-a-doctorate).

## Ways to train

### Go to university as a postgraduate student

If you already have a degree and want to go through university again, you could do a university-led PGCE or PGDE leading to qualified teacher status.

You spend about a third of your time in academic learning and two thirds of your time in placement schools.  

You’ll have an academic qualification at the end of your training, which you can use towards masters credits.

Courses typically take one year but you may be able to study part time.

Fees are usually around £9,250 but you can get [non-repayable funding for certain subjects](/funding-your-training) and apply for a [student loan](/funding-your-training).

### Learn on the job in schools near you

You’ll find lots of training programmes leading to qualified teacher status run by schools or groups of schools.

You’ll spend most of your time in practical learning, and only about one fifth of your time in academic learning.

Many courses even give you a PGCE or PGDE and credits that you can use towards a masters. 

Although you sometimes have to pay course fees of up to £9,250 you can get [non-repayable funding for certain subjects](link) and apply for a [student loan](link).

Some training programmes offer a salary, although these can be harder to find.

#### Teach First

You could also consider [Teach First](https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/). This practical, salaried, 2-year programme leads to a postgraduate diploma in education’ (PGDE), similar to a PGCE, and qualified teacher status.

### If you do not have a degree yet

You can get qualified teacher status as part of an undergraduate degree course.

Qualifications vary depending on the course you choose. For example, you could get a BA honours degree with QTS, or a BSc honours with QTS.

Courses typically cost £9,250 per year and can take up to 4 years - but you can [get funding](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance-calculator).

### If you already have teaching experience

If you’re an experienced teacher with a degree, you may be able to get QTS without doing a teacher training programme.

You can [apply directly to assessment only teacher training providers](/assessment-only-providers).

Contact providers for advice about entry criteria.

### If you are a career changer

A career change into teaching will give you the opportunity to use your life, work experience and passion for your subject to inspire young people.

[Now Teach](https://nowteach.org.uk/) and [Transition to Teach](https://www.transitiontoteach.co.uk/) can support you with your career change.

### If you have a doctorate

[Researchers in schools](https://thebrilliantclub.org/researchers-in-schools/) offers a route into teaching if you have or are about to get a PHD. If you have a lot of relevant work experience you could even earn a salary.
