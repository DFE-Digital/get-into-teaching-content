To teach in a state school in England, you must have a degree, and gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). There are a number of ways to gain QTS, such as completion of postgraduate initial teacher training (ITT) or an undergraduate degree course with QTS included.

### Things to consider

There are a few ways to train to become a teacher. Each route has different eligibility criteria, end qualifications, and funding options. These will depend on which school or training provider you select and the type of training they provide.

You may be eligible for funding to pay course fees and support with living costs whilst in training.

</p>

### Subject knowledge enhancement (SKE)

If you need to top up your knowledge of the subject you want to teach, you could take a [subject knowledge enhancement course (SKE)](/guidance/become-a-teacher-in-england#subject-knowledge-enhancement-courses)

$get-a-tta$

$pgce$

PGCE programmes combine academic study with a minimum of 24 weeks spent training in schools.

You do not need an academic award such as a PGCE to teach in England, but it may be useful if you want to teach in another country.

<p class="call-to-action__action">
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses">Find a PGCE <span>course</span></a>
</p>

$school-direct-fee-funded$

School Direct (fee-funded) programmes mean you’ll learn on the job while you work towards your Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). You’ll be based in a school, but you won’t be employed by them. You’ll learn on the job and be taught by the university, college, or school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) provider that the school partners with.

Most School Direct programmes lead to a PGCE, but not all do — check with the training provider before applying.

</p>

$school-direct-salaried$

On a School Direct (salaried) programme, you’ll be employed by a school as an unqualified teacher while you work towards your Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). You’ll earn a salary and don’t need to pay any tuition fees. This route typically requires three years of transferable work history.

Most School Direct programmes lead to a PGCE, but not all do — check with the training provider before applying.

</p>

$postgraduate-teaching-apprenticeship$

You’ll be employed by a school and learn while you’re working. You’ll split your time between school and university study, with at least 20% of your time studying.

</p>

$teach-first$

The Teach First Leadership Development Programme is a two-year salaried programme. It combines leadership development with teacher training, and focuses on training exceptional teachers to teach in challenging schools.

You’ll learn on the job while you work towards Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and a Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE). A PGDE contains up to 120 credits at master’s degree level.

</p>

$assessment-only$

If you’re an experienced teacher with a degree, you can gain QTS without doing a teacher training programme. You’ll need to present detailed evidence that you meet the standards for QTS.

A number of universities and School Centred Initial Teacher Training programmes (SCITTs) around the country offer Assessment Only routes. Their criteria for entry may vary, and you will need to apply to them directly.

For more information about Assessment Only options, you can view a list of approved providers in our directory.

## Other ways to train

There are a number of specialised routes into teaching.

### Career changers

If you want a [career change and fancy becoming a teacher](/guidance/become-a-teacher-in-england#career-changers), you’ll get the chance to use your life and work experience coupled with your passion for your subject to inspire young people. There's plenty of support to get into teaching and make the career change.

### Researchers in schools

You’ll need (or be about to finish) a doctorate in the [subject you want to teach](/guidance/become-a-teacher-in-england#researchers-in-schools-candidates-with-a-doctorate). You’ll then train over 3 years with a bursary. If you have a lot of relevant work experience you could [train and earn a salary](https://thebrilliantclub.org/researchers-in-schools/ris-applicants/ris-training-routes/salary-route/).

### Postgraduate Early Years Initial Teacher Training (EYITT)

A number of postgraduate Early Years Initial Teacher Training (EYITT) courses are available at university or via a school-led route – all lead to [Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS)](/guidance/become-a-teacher-in-england#teaching-under-fives) on successful completion. EYTS is different to QTS in that you specialise in working with children up to five years old only.
